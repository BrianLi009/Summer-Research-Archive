## Welcome to my first post!
Hello everyone! Thank you for checking out my first blog post. I would like to share some cool ideas and concepts in mathematics that [Professor Parker Glynn-Adey](https://pgadey.ca/) and I have been exploring over the summer. During this summer, I will be posting ideas in the area of random permutations, Boolean functions Fourier analysis, mathematical magic tricks, and hopefully some other interesting findings. I hope this blog site can act as a platform for me to connect with students and faculties who share a common interest.

A bit about myself, I am a third year student at the University of Toronto Mississauga. I have a great passion in Mathematics and where that passion comes from is hard to explain. I suppose for me, Math is one of the few fields where truth exists and can be proven. All the subjects that I am keen of have this "element of truth" in it.

Over the summer, I will be posting every Tuesday or Wednesday. If you have questions or comments about my future posts, feel free to contact me, I have attached my email address on the main page.
